        <div class="post-date">Friday, December 22, 2023</div>
        <p>
          I wasn't expecting big things from December's <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=38490811">Ask HN: Who is hiring? thread</a>. December is typically a slow month anyway in the hiring cycle. But, with <a href="/2023/november.html">November's thread</a> showing a little upwards momentum</a>, December's results would be an interesting sign if that growth could be sustained after a year of steady declines.

        <p>
          November's <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=38099086">Ask HN: Who is hiring?</a> thread showed continued growth with 375 postings, up 20% from the near all-time low in September, and up 10% over October's thread. This is a positive sign after months of declines. However, on a year-over-year basis, we're still way off of the 2022 numbers (down 30%) and the 2021 numbers dwarf where we are today (down 61% since November, 2021).

        <h3><a href="2023/october.html">AI Rising: Now the most-cited technology</a></h3>
        <div class="post-date">Sunday, October 29, 2023</div>
        <p>
          The term AI can mean many different things in the context of software
          development and programming. However, its significance in the current
          tech job market cannot be understated. The data reveals that for
          October's "Ask HN: Who is hiring?" thread, AI is the most mentioned 
          technology term. AI was mentioned in nearly 20% of the postings. It has
          doubled, from 10% of postings in October, 2022, to the new peak. The
          only terms more popular than AI are location aspects (Remote vs onsite),
          experience level (Senior), and area of focus (full stack). For October,
          AI was more popular than any technology tracked in the history of the
          "Ask HN: Who is hiring?" thread. More popular than Python and React, the
          long-time dominant tech terms.

        <p>
          <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37351667">September's "Ask HN: Who hiring?" thread</a>
          hit an eight-year low, as job posts continued their downward trend. We have to go back to January 2015
          to when the number of postings was this low. But, September is in thet past and a new thread goes
          up tomorrow (Monday) morning. With Summer now over, October's thread could be a chance for a
          nice Fall bump.

        <div class="post-date">Sunday, July 2, 2023</div>
        <p>
          It should come as little surprise that the number of job postings on 
          <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/submitted?id=whoishiring">whoishiring</a>
          threads continues to slow heading into summer. Between the general
          market slowness and summer vacation season starting, June dropped to
          a new longtime low of 359 postings. Perhaps the lowest of what I
          consider the modern era of "Who is Hiring?". The last time postings
          were this low was January 2015. "Who is Hiring?" had only surpassed
          500 postings once before then though, so its popularity as a job
          board was nowhere near where it is today.

          Change is happening fast in the software developer hiring landscape. Let's jump in and take a look at the results from <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=35773707">May's Hacker News "Ask HN: Who is hiring?"</a> thread.
        </p>
        <p>
          First, in a positive sign, there were 431 postings (as of May 21), which marks a 12% increase over <a href="/2023/april.html">April</a>. April's total was the lowest in over 7 years, so it's good to see some growth in job opportunites.

        <p>
          The main theme from <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=35424807">April's Ask HN: Who is hiring?</a> thread is that the downward trend on postings continues. April had 384 job postings, down almost 13% from March. This is the lowest total since December of 2015. Year over year, April 2023 is down 51% from April 2022.
