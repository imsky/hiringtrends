        <div class="post-date">Sunday, July 2, 2023</div>
        <p>
          It should come as little surprise that the number of job postings on 
          <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/submitted?id=whoishiring">whoishiring</a>
          threads continues to slow heading into summer. Between the general
          market slowness and summer vacation season starting, June dropped to
          a new longtime low of 359 postings. Perhaps the lowest of what I
          consider the modern era of "Who is Hiring?". The last time postings
          were this low was January 2015. "Who is Hiring?" had only surpassed
          500 postings once before then though, so its popularity has a job
          board was nowhere near where it is today.

          Change is happening fast in the software developer hiring landscape. Let's jump in and take a look at the results from <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=35773707">May's Hacker News "Ask HN: Who is hiring?"</a> thread.
        </p>
        <p>
          First, in a positive sign, there were 431 postings (as of May 21), which marks a 12% increase over <a href="/2023/april.html">April</a>. April's total was the lowest in over 7 years, so it's good to see some growth in job opportunites.

        <p>
          The main theme from <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=35424807">April's Ask HN: Who is hiring?</a> thread is that the downward trend on postings continues. April had 384 job postings, down almost 13% from March. This is the lowest total since December of 2015. Year over year, April 2023 is down 51% from April 2022.

          The Software Developer job industry is facing many changing dynamics, and the data from the <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=34983767">"Ask HN: Who is hiring?" thread on Hacker News</a> is a great way to track the changes. From the overall drop in job postings, the return of work to the office, to the rise in AI technogies poised to cause disruption to the way we work.

          What a difference a year makes. The number of job postings in the <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=33422129">"Ask HN: Who is hiring?" thread for November</a> bounced back a bit from October's near all-time low, but was still way down from last year. For November, there were 555 postings (top level comments), up 13% over October. But, postings are down year-over-year, 45%, from November 2021.

          Python is once again the top programming language after losing to TypeScript the last two months. Previous to the last two months' defeat, Python had been the top programming language for six years. Will it stay on top again, or will this battle between Python and TypeScript go back and forth into the future?
