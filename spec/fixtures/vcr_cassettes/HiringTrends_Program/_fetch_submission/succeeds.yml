        is a new digital platform presenting live concert events on the web and mobile
        devices in handsome HD, with supporting content that provides a more powerful
        connection between artists and their online fan bases. Liveset brings the
        concert experience to artists fans across the Internet as their show is happening
        and provides a platform for fans to watch an archived show at their convenience.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWere
        going to make live shows as easy as Youtube. Our goal is to build a site for
        music fans that has an equally impressive set of features as MLB.tv. We also
        need to build out our own proprietary live-streaming platform  were currently
        using livestream.com, and wed love to talk to you about why we want to replace
        it (no offense to livestream - they''ve been great partners).\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eLiveset
        is a functioning, funded platform that needs help getting to the next level.  The
        platform was launched on September 29, 2010, and has been very well received.  Weve
        done all of the development work through a contract relationship with a talented
        design and development firm out of New York (@crushlovely), but we want someone
        as committed as we are to come on board.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThat means
        were offering a real founders spot. We need a Lead Developer, and were willing
        to offer a 20% equity stake to the right person.  The post-money valuation
        on our last round was $2.5 million (weve raised $500,000).  That means were
        offering up to a half-million (on paper, of course) for joining. We know that
        successful projects are built on talented engineers, and we mean business
        about bringing you on board.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe site is built in
        Rails.  We need a partner whos willing and eager to get in on the ground floor
        and help us build this into the platform we know it can be.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWhy
        do you need co-founders if youre such an awesome developer?  Were experienced
        at what we do. One of your partners spent 7 years on the other side of the
        table at a media-focused private equity firm. Another one has already built
        a successful video production company and is building another product, with
        plenty of investor interest. Well raise money and keep your bills paid. Weve
        already made dozens of connections (maybe youve heard of some of the bands
        on the current site, and you \u003ci\u003eHAVE\u003c/i\u003e heard of some
        of the bands we cant talk about yet). Weve made more connections you cant
        see: artists, booking agents, venues, managers, labels, sponsors, potential
        investors, consultants, entrepreneurs, streaming providers, CDNs, development
        firms, designers, etc. We know youve heard we need a technical co-founder
        like theyre replaceable, and we know better. We know the live streaming concert
        industry as well as anyone out there.  And weve done it all with just 2 people
        - were not an over-funded New York VC-backed startup trying to buy instead
        of build.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWe mean it. Get in touch and let us show
        you what we have to offer. Itll be fun and profitable, we promise!\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003ePlus
        were in New Orleans  and if you were at RubyConf2010, you know how great a
        city this is. How about a bunch of free live music in one of the best music
        cities in the world? Awesome food? Great co-workers? We love this town, and
        well be sure you know its impossible not to.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eActual-work

        really, aside from the moving, none of that is as important as what you bring
        to the table. Were not looking to give away 20% of an angel-funded company
        so we can tell you what to do. Weve also got enough money raised that we can
        pay you a lot more than ramen money (and you can live like a king in New Orleans
        for half of what youd make in California or New York). You dont need to forgo
        your IRA contributions for this gig.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWe are firm
        about you coming to New Orleans. Were looking for a true partner. Given our
        small size and the fact that this is our first in-house developer, we really
        need you on the ground here with us. We want you there with us on the crazy
        late nights before a show...  and at the over the top celebration dinners
        afterwards. Were fully committed to this (some of that funding is our own
        money) and want someone who is able to fully commit as well.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eTo

        and Python is a plus, but not required. \n- Ability to touch many different
        parts of our system such as: deploying a new set of boxes on EC2, debugging
        network inefficiencies, implementing optimized graphics algorithms in C or
        OpenGL, writing optimized SQL queries, writing full python classes, or writing
        NodeJS applications. Point is: you should be able to pick up new things very

        a small team, and we''re looking for people to make a big impact. This means

        the solution set, and be able to pick the right course of development given
        the set of constraints. Of course we''re looking for great engineering talent,

        -- Polyvore is a social shopping platform. Our user community curates and

        team of 18 people, including a lot of folks from Google and Yahoo.  Our founders
        are all engineers or have computer science backgrounds, so we''re very technical
        and eng/product-driven.  You can see the profiles of our team members here.  It''s
        also a really fun working environment.  Our Happy Hours activities range from
        board games to taco trucks to book club (with beer and other equally attractive
        drinks!).\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003ePolyvore has a lot of interesting product
        challenges and neat technology under the hood.  For example:\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe

        Analytics -- Our users interact with tons of products on a daily basis (50K
